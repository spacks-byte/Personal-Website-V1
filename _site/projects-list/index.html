<h2>GPoznanS</h2>
<p><strong>API Visualizaion Web App</strong> | <em>August 2023</em></p>
<p>The project is a data visualization web app based around the streamlit rapid development library for python. It utilizes the free APIs shared by the city of Poznan to pinpoint the location of certain crucial points on the city map. The project also uses streamlit's folium component which makes the map a lot more detailed and easy to work with in comparison to other streamlit map objects.</p>

<h2>Solar &amp; Lunar Playing Cards</h2>
<p><strong>Custom Deck of Playing Cards</strong> | <em>October 2019</em></p>
<p>As part of my middle school final project I designed and produced 50 custom prototype decks of playing cards. The cards were produced by the largest card company in the world Cartamundi and use their standard True Linen B9 finish.</p>
<p>The cards designs are based on very simple geometric shapes (triangles and circles) which when combined make up all of the more complex design elements on the card faces. This project was my first attempt at designing something digital and then getting it into production which ultimately left me with a physical product as an outcome of my work.</p>
<p>As an additional challenge I decided to use this opportunity to plan out a possible crowdfunding campaign around the product.</p>
